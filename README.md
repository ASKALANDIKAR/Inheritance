# Inheritance🧬

This repository showcases different types of **Inheritance in Java**, organized systematically through well-structured packages and clear, practical examples, This code help's learners and developers to understand how inheritance works in real-world scenarios

> 💡 Inspired and mentored by **The Kiran Academy (TKA)**

## 📁 Project Structure

- `tka` package – Starting point to understand Inheritance working 
- `Practice` – Individual files covering different Inheritance-related problems (UpDating.....)

## 🧠 Inheritance Types Covered

### 🔹 Single Inheritance (`com.single_inheritance`)
- Demonstrates one class inheriting directly from another.
- Examples:
  - `Dog` extends `Animal`
  - `Car` extends `Vehicle`

### 🔹 Multi-Level Inheritance (`com.multi_level_inheritance`)
- Involves a class inheriting from a class which is itself a child of another class.
- Examples:
  - `Person → Employee → Manager`
  - `Device → Computer → Laptop`

### 🔹 Hybrid Inheritance (`com.hybrid_inheritance`)
- Combines more than one type of inheritance.
- This is simulated using multiple classes like:
  - `Father`, `Mother`, `Uncle`, `Aunt`, `Son`, `Daughter`, etc.
- Shows conceptual hybrid relationships (Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance with classes, only with interfaces).

### 🧪 Demo Package: `com.tka`
- This package serves as a **demo zone** for inheritance examples.
- Focuses on how inheritance chains are constructed and used.
- Contains:
  - `Family → Father → GrandFather`

## ▶️ How to Run

Each package has its own **main class** for testing:

| Package                      | Main Class        |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| `com.tka`                   | `Family.java`     |
| `com.multi_level_inheritance.problem1` | `Manager.java`    |
| `com.multi_level_inheritance.problem2` | `Laptop.java`     |
| `com.single_inheritance`    | `Dog.java`, `Car.java` |

Open these files in your IDE (like IntelliJ) and run them to see the inheritance behavior in action.
